Hello Viewers,

0:00:02.980 --> 0:00:09.389
This is one of the POC web application,  which
I have developed for one of the Automative

0:00:09.389 --> 0:00:13.549
corporate.
This is developed using Spring framework and

0:00:13.549 --> 0:00:18.429
Kendo UI.
And in the backend,  I am using Glassfish web

0:00:18.429 --> 0:00:22.619
server and Postgresql DB server.

0:00:22.619 --> 0:00:29.029
This is a simple login screen.
Of course,  I am using Spring Security in this

0:00:29.029 --> 0:00:29.720
web.

0:00:29.720 --> 0:00:36.239
As you can see few sample user ids listed
here to login and test

0:00:36.239 --> 0:00:43.239
At the bottom you can see an icon for Android
demo application which is .apk file which

0:00:43.239 --> 0:00:51.559
you can download and install into your mobile
phone and browse as a

0:00:51.559 --> 0:00:56.120
external user.
External user can reserve the carpark and

0:00:56.120 --> 0:01:05.420
view his booking slots from his mobile.
Also I am going to show you the demo on how his

0:01:05.420 --> 0:01:11.930
reservations are reflected into the POC web
application.
